# MT3000 Focus Router

This repo documents a distraction-blocking setup built around a `GL.iNet GL-MT3000`.

## Goal

- keep two router-side blocklists:
  - `always blocked`
  - `workday blocked`
- make bypass harder than device-side blocking
- preserve narrow exceptions for required services such as a work VPN
- fully disable internet access each day from `18:30` to `04:00`
- provide a small LAN-only page that shows status and lets new entries be appended

## Current Design

- `policy manager`
  - validates input
  - stores canonical lists on the router
  - compiles the active AdGuard rules for the current time window
  - applies updates safely and restores the previous config on restart failure
- `router enforcement`
  - `AdGuard Home` for domain blocking
  - firewall rules to reduce DNS bypass
  - a scheduled LAN-to-WAN curfew rule
  - `IPv6` disabled
- `local management app`
  - LAN-only
  - shows current mode and both blocklists
  - lets a new host be added to either `always` or `workday`

## Schedule

- `04:00` to `16:30`: `always + workday`
- `16:30` to `18:30`: `always` only
- `18:30` to `04:00`: internet off

## Local Testing

Run the Lua test suite with:

```powershell
lua tests\run.lua
```
