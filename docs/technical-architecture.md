# Technical Architecture

## Summary

The current router-side system has three parts:

- `Policy Manager`
- `Router Enforcement`
- `Local Management App`

Everything runs on the `GL.iNet GL-MT3000`.

## Components

### Policy Manager

The policy manager lives in shared Lua modules plus the `focusctl` CLI entrypoint.

It:

- reads the canonical source lists
- validates and normalizes input
- compiles the active AdGuard rules for the current time window
- updates AdGuard Home safely
- restores the previous AdGuard config if restart fails
- installs the schedule that keeps policy and firewall state in sync

### Router Enforcement

Router enforcement uses:

- `AdGuard Home` for DNS blocking
- firewall rules to reduce DNS bypass
- a scheduled firewall curfew that blocks `LAN -> WAN` traffic from `18:30` to `04:00`
- `IPv6` disabled

### Local Management App

The local app is a LAN-only CGI page.

It:

- shows current mode and protection status
- shows the `always` and `workday` blocklists separately
- accepts one new domain or URL at a time
- lets the user choose which list to append to
- triggers a policy apply after successful submission

## Persistent State

The router stores:

- `/etc/focus/always-blocked.txt`
- `/etc/focus/workday-blocked.txt`
- `/etc/focus/passthrough-rules.txt`
- `/etc/AdGuardHome/config.yaml`
- `/etc/crontabs/root`

## Active Modes

- `04:00` to `16:30`
  - `always + workday`
- `16:30` to `18:30`
  - `always` only
- `18:30` to `04:00`
  - internet off

Weekend behavior currently matches weekdays.

## Main Flows

### Manual Edit

1. Update one of the files in `/etc/focus/`.
2. Run `focusctl sync`.
3. Keep the previous config if apply or restart fails.

### App Addition

1. Submit a domain or URL in the local app.
2. Normalize and validate the hostname.
3. Update `always` or `workday`.
4. Rebuild the active AdGuard rules for the current mode.
5. Reload the page with the result.

### Scheduled Sync

1. `cron` runs `focusctl sync`.
2. The policy manager computes the current mode from router local time.
3. It writes the correct AdGuard rule set.
4. It enables or disables the firewall curfew rule as needed.

## Boundaries

- the router is the trust boundary
- client devices are not trusted
- the local app is not an admin console
- the local app cannot delete entries, edit passthrough rules, or disable enforcement
